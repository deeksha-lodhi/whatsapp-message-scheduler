# WhatsApp Message Scheduler
We can schedule a WhatsApp message and send it to a contact or a group.
- Used streamlit to create the webapp.
- Used pywhatkit to automate the task.
  
To use it on your system,
- install the required items from requirements.txt
- streamlit run main.py: this opens a web app on your browser.
- make sure you have WhatsApp logged in on the browser.
